    "- **Reduced Bugs**: Fewer loops mean fewer opportunities for indexing errors\n",
    "- **Mathematical Clarity**: Code structure mirrors mathematical notation more closely\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Easier to read, understand, and modify vectorized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Processing Power**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Fundamentals\n",
    "Matrices are two-dimensional arrays where all elements are of the same data type. They form the backbone of linear algebra operations in machine learning and are essential for efficient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Notation and Conventions\n",
    "- **Matrix Notation**: Matrices are denoted with capital, bold letters such as $\\mathbf{X}$, $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "- **Dimensions**: \n",
    "  - $m$ = number of rows (typically represents number of training examples)\n",
    "  - $n$ = number of columns (typically represents number of features)\n",
    "  - Matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Matrix with Bias Term\n",
    "In machine learning, we often augment our feature matrix to include a bias term. The bias $b$ is incorporated as the **first column** of the matrix, consisting of all ones. This allows us to combine the bias and weights into a single matrix operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(1)} & x_2^{(1)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(1)} \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(2)} & x_2^{(2)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(2)} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_1^{(m)} & x_2^{(m)} & \\cdots & x_n^{(m)}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times (n+1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Bias Integration:**\n",
    "- **Simplified Computation**: $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}_{\\text{augmented}} \\mathbf{w}$ instead of $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w} + b$\n",
    "- **Vectorized Operations**: All parameters (weights + bias) updated simultaneously\n",
    "- **Cleaner Implementation**: Reduces code complexity and potential for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Element Indexing\n",
    "- **Superscript notation**: $x^{(i)}$ refers to the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Subscript notation**: $x_j^{(i)}$ refers to the $j^{th}$ feature of the $i^{th}$ training example\n",
    "- **Python indexing**: Remember that NumPy uses 0-based indexing (first element is index 0)"

    "- Cleaner, more readable syntax that mirrors mathematical notation\n",
    "- Specifically designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- **Recommended for new code**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `np.matmul()` - The Explicit Matrix Multiplication**\n",
    "- Explicitly designed for matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Similar to `@` operator (in fact, `@` calls `matmul` internally)\n",
    "- Useful when you want to emphasize that you're doing matrix multiplication\n",
    "- Handles broadcasting differently than `np.dot()` for higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Multiplication Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "For matrix multiplication $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}$:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{A}$ has shape $(m, k)$\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{B}$ has shape $(k, n)$\n",
    "- Result $\\mathbf{C}$ has shape $(m, n)$\n",
    "- **Critical Rule**: Number of columns in $\\mathbf{A}$ must equal number of rows in $\\mathbf{B}$\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides the [`LinearRegression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) class, which implements a **closed-form solution** for linear regression using the **Normal Equation**. This approach computes the optimal weights directly through matrix algebra, without requiring iterative optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation: The Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ **Ideal Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Scikit-learn: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides the [`SGDRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html) class, which implements **Stochastic Gradient Descent** for linear regression. Unlike batch gradient descent (which uses all training examples in each iteration) or the closed-form solution (which requires expensive matrix inversion), SGD updates weights using **one or a few examples at a time**, making it highly scalable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Stochastic Gradient Descent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Gradient Descent** (what you implemented):\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} := \\mathbf{w} - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\nabla J^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **all** $m$ training examples per update\n",
    "- Smooth, consistent convergence\n",
    "- Computationally expensive for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} := \\mathbf{w} - \\alpha \\nabla J^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **one** randomly selected example per update\n",
    "- Much faster iterations\n",
    "- Noisy convergence path, but reaches good solution quickly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** (what SGDRegressor typically uses):\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} := \\mathbf{w} - \\alpha \\frac{1}{b} \\sum_{i=1}^{b} \\nabla J^{(i)}(\\mathbf{w})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **small batch** of $b$ examples per update (e.g., $b = 32, 64, 128$)\n",
    "- Balances speed and stability\n",
    "- Best of both worlds for most applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences: Batch GD vs. SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Batch Gradient Descent | Stochastic Gradient Descent |\n",
    "|--------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| **Examples per Update** | All $m$ examples | 1 or small batch ($b$) |\n",
    "| **Iteration Speed** | Slow for large data | Very fast ⚡ |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Scaling is Critical for SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **The SGD solution performs best with normalized inputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: SGD uses a **single learning rate** $\\alpha$ for all features. Without scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features with large ranges (e.g., house size: 500-5000 sqft) cause large gradients\n",
    "- Features with small ranges (e.g., bedrooms: 1-5) cause small gradients\n",
    "- One learning rate cannot work well for both → slow or unstable convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All features have similar ranges (typically mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- Gradients are balanced across all features\n",
    "- Learning rate works uniformly → **fast, stable convergence** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scaling Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# StandardScaler: (x - mean) / std_dev → mean=0, std=1\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",

    "- **Online/streaming data** (model updates as new data arrives)\n",

    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new example $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}}$, the prediction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}_{\\text{new}} = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{\\text{new}} = b + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + w_4 x_4$$\n",

    "### Critical: Feature Scaling for Predictions ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Most Common Mistake in ML:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ WRONG - Using raw features\n",
    "x_new = [1650, 3, 2, 20]\n",
    "prediction = model.predict([x_new])  # Will give wrong result!\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✓ CORRECT - Scaling new features first\n",
    "x_new = [1650, 3, 2, 20]\n",
    "x_new_scaled = scaler.transform([x_new])  # Use same scaler from training\n",
    "prediction = model.predict(x_new_scaled)  # Correct prediction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Scaling Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your models were trained on **scaled features** (mean=0, std=1)\n",
    "- New data must be transformed using the **same scaling parameters**\n",
    "- Use `scaler.transform()` (NOT `fit_transform()`) on new data\n",
    "- `fit_transform()` would compute NEW scaling parameters → wrong predictions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Approaches for Each Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Your Gradient Descent Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Manually create feature vector with bias term\n",
    "x_new = np.array([1, x1_scaled, x2_scaled, x3_scaled, x4_scaled])\n",
    "prediction = np.dot(w, x_new)  # or w @ x_new\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. LinearRegression (sklearn):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use .predict() method (handles bias automatically)\n",
    "x_new_scaled = scaler.transform([[1650, 3, 2, 20]])\n",
    "prediction = lr_model.predict(x_new_scaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. SGDRegressor (sklearn):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use .predict() method (handles bias automatically)\n",
    "x_new_scaled = scaler.transform([[1650, 3, 2, 20]])\n",
    "prediction = sgd_model.predict(x_new_scaled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Should See:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All three predictions should be **very close** to each other:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gradient Descent Prediction: $292,450\n",
    "Linear Regression Prediction: $292,470\n",
    "SGD Regressor Prediction:     $292,430\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All predictions within **2-3% of each other** ✓\n",
    "- Predictions make **intuitive sense** (reasonable house price) ✓\n",
    "- No negative prices or extreme outliers ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "### What If Predictions Differ Significantly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If predictions vary by more than 5%, check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Scaling Issues**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Did you scale the new features using the same scaler?\n",
    "   - Are you using `transform()` not `fit_transform()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias Term Handling**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - For your GD model: Did you prepend `1` for the bias?\n",
    "   - For sklearn models: They handle bias automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Convergence**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Did your gradient descent fully converge?\n",
    "   - Check the cost plot - should flatten out\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parameter Extraction**\n",
